## Services

### ThemeService

This service provides a way to change the theme (light vs dark) of the Bootstrap library. It automatically detects the user's system theme and sets the theme accordingly. But you can also manually set the via
a service implementing `ThemeProvider` interface provided by `THEME_PROVIDER_TOKEN`.

There is a built-in service `LocalStorageThemeService` that saves the theme in the local storage. It's provided by default via `THEME_PROVIDER_TOKEN`.
By injecting the `ThemeService` in your `AppComponent`, it will automatically set the theme and respond to changes to user's system theme 
and changes to the theme via the `ThemeProvider`.

## Components

### ThemePickerComponent

This component provides a way to change the theme (light vs dark) of the Bootstrap library. It displays a dropdown menu with three options: Light, Dark and Auto.
When the user selects a theme, it changes the theme via the `ThemeProvider` provider  by `THEME_PROVIDER_TOKEN` (`LocalStorageThemeService` by default).
The changes are reflected in the `ThemeService` service and the theme of the page is set accordingly.

### Example Usage

```typescript

import {
	ThemePickerComponent,
	ThemeService,
} from '@code-art-eg/angular-bootstrap';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
	  template: `
	<div class="container my-5">
		<bs-theme-picker></bs-theme-picker>
	</div>
  `
})
export class AppComponent {
	// by injecting the service, it will automatically set the theme and respond to changes to user's system theme and changes to the theme via the ThemeProvider.
	private themeService = inject(ThemeService);
  	constructor() {}
  	toggleTheme() {
  	}
